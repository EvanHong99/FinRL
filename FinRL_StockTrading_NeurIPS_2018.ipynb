Design Environment\n","Considering the stochastic and interactive nature of the automated stock trading tasks, a financial task is modeled as a **Markov Decision Process (MDP)** problem. The training process involves observing stock price change, taking an action and reward's calculation to have the agent adjusting its strategy accordingly. By interacting with the environment, the trading agent will derive a trading strategy with the maximized rewards as time proceeds.\n","\n","Our trading environments, based on OpenAI Gym framework, simulate live stock markets with real market data according to the principle of time-driven simulation.\n","\n","The action space describes the allowed actions that the agent interacts with the environment. Normally, action a includes three actions: {-1, 0, 1}, where -1, 0, 1 represent selling, holding, and buying one share. Also, an action can be carried upon multiple shares. We use an action space {-k,…,-1, 0, 1, …, k}, where k denotes the number of shares to buy and -k denotes the number of shares to sell. For example, \"Buy 10 shares of AAPL\" or \"Sell 10 shares of AAPL\" are 10 or -10, respectively. The continuous action space needs to be normalized to [-1, 1], since the policy is defined on a Gaussian distribution, which needs to be normalized and symmetric."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"5TOhcryx44bb"},"source":["## Training data split: 2009-01-01 to 2020-07-01\n","## Trade data split: 2020-07-01 to 2021-10-31"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["root='/content/drive/MyDrive/HYF/Graduation_Fin/FinRL'\n","%cd /content/drive/MyDrive/HYF/Graduation_Fin/FinRL\n","from finrl import config\n","from finrl import config_tickers\n","import os\n","if not os.path.exists(root+\"/\" + config.DATA_SAVE_DIR):\n","    os.makedirs(root+\"/\" + config.DATA_SAVE_DIR)\n","if not os.path.exists(root+\"/\" + config.TRAINED_MODEL_DIR):\n","    os.makedirs(root+\"/\" + config.TRAINED_MODEL_DIR)\n","if not os.path.exists(root+\"/\" + config.TENSORBOARD_LOG_DIR):\n","    os.makedirs(root+\"/\" + config.TENSORBOARD_LOG_DIR)\n","if not os.path.exists(root+\"/\" + config.RESULTS_DIR):\n","    os.makedirs(root+\"/\" + config.RESULTS_DIR)\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","# matplotlib.use('Agg')\n","import datetime\n","\n","%matplotlib inline\n","from finrl.finrl_meta.preprocessor.yahoodownloader import YahooDownloader\n","from finrl.finrl_meta.preprocessor.tusharedownloader import TushareDownloader\n","# from finrl.finrl_meta.preprocessor.processor_joinquant import JoinQuantEngineer\n","from finrl.finrl_meta.preprocessor.preprocessors import FeatureEngineer, data_split\n","# from finrl.finrl_meta.env_stock_trading.env_stocktrading import StockTradingEnv\n","from finrl.finrl_meta.env_stock_trading.env_test import StockTradingEnv\n","\n","from finrl.agents.stablebaselines3.models import DRLAgent\n","from finrl.finrl_meta.data_processor import DataProcessor\n","\n","from finrl.plot import backtest_stats, backtest_plot, get_daily_return, get_baseline\n","from pprint import pprint\n","\n","import sys\n","sys.path.append(\"../FinRL-Library\")\n","\n","import itertools\n","import jqdatasdk\n","jqdatasdk.auth('15857500957','Qazwsxedcrfv0957')"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"pzVsr9zP5VOt","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1649494195075,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":10464,"user":{"displayName":"丁一凡","userId":"12694145791535851103"}},"outputId":"b9ac833f-dd59-4a0e-b768-b80c0daac0be"},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["/content/drive/MyDrive/HYF/Graduation_Fin/FinRL\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/pyfolio/pos.py:27: UserWarning: Module \"zipline.assets\" not found; mutltipliers will not be applied to position notionals.\n","  'Module \"zipline.assets\" not found; mutltipliers will not be applied' +\n","/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/distributed/config.py:20: YAMLLoadWarning: calling yaml.load() without Loader=... is deprecated, as the default Loader is unsafe.
